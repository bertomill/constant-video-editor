          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            I did everything right. Succeeded in school. Went to business school. Landed a job in finance.
            On paper, I had made it.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            But I absolutely hated it.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">The Creativity Crisis</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            All the creativity was gone. I was no longer a maker. I was just another cog in the machine,
            pushing spreadsheets and sitting in meetings that could have been emails.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 font-medium">
            I had to break out.

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">The Leap</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            I started my journey to become a freelance software developer. Then I began posting YouTube videos,
            sharing what I was learning and building.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            Along the way, I started a community called <span className="font-semibold">Makers Lounge</span> &mdash;
            a space for creators and developers in Toronto. Today, it has over 1,000 members.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">The Moment Everything Changed</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            One of my YouTube videos hit <span className="font-semibold">15,000 views</span>. That single video
            opened doors I didn&apos;t even know existed. Opportunities started coming in.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Then something even crazier happened. I posted one Instagram photo with my girlfriend &mdash;
            just a normal photo &mdash; and it got <span className="font-semibold">215,000 views</span>.
            My other posts? Maybe 1,000 views on a good day.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 font-medium">
            Why did that one blow up?

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">The Question That Became VidSwan</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            I became obsessed with one question: <em>How do you make every video a big video?</em>
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            What makes certain content explode while similar content gets ignored? What are the patterns?
            What are the anomalies?
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            That obsession led to <span className="font-semibold">VidSwan</span> &mdash; a tool built to identify
            the videos that will be anomalies. To help creators understand what makes content break through the noise.

        <section className="mb-8 bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            We&apos;re building VidSwan to help every creator find their breakout moments. Because we believe
            that understanding what makes content resonate shouldn&apos;t be a guessing game &mdash; it should be a science.
